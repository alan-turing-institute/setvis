    "This tutorial notebook builds on (`Tutorial Example.ipynb`), and takes another approach to analysing the data missingness from the same synthetic APC dataset.\n",

    "**Objectives for this tutorial:**\n",
    "  - Learn how to select particular combinations of missingness programmatically with PACE (rather than interactively)\n",
    "  - Explain unexpected patterns of missing data by using data mining techniques"
